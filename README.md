##INSTAGRAM AT THE MET
This is using js to pull #MetMuseum images from instagram. 

***NOTE: the refresh is set to 10seconds and the pagination is set to 100 (i.e 30 x 100 = 3,000 images will be displayed.)***

*** For best visuals through a browser "zoom out" until you see the images in a grid pattern on your screen that is most desiarable. Then set browser to "Presenter Mode". ***
